A programming language.

## About

This is a toy programming language, purely for educational purposes. This project explores the idea of having a C-like programming language that can run on the [Common Language Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr). The language has an emphasis on C programming structure with simple functions and structs, but it is also garbage collected.
